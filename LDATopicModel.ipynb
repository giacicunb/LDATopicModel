    "# Creating LDA Topic Model with Gensim\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA’s approach to topic modeling is to classify text in a document to a particular topic. Modeled as Dirichlet distributions, LDA builds a topic per document model and words per topic model. After providing the LDA topic model algorithm, in order to obtain a good composition of topic-keyword distribution, it re-arrange the topics distributions within the document and the keywords distribution within the topics. Here, we are going to use LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to extract the naturally discussed topics from dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset which we are going to use is the dataset of ’20 Newsgroups’ having thousands of news articles from various sections of a news report. It is available under Sklearn data sets. We used the following Python script to download it and we can also look at some of the sample news."

(i realize\\nthis is a real subjective question, but i\\'ve only played around with the\\nmachines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody\\nwho actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful).\\n\\n* how well does hellcats perform?  ;)\\n\\nthanks a bunch in advance for any info - if you could email, i\\'ll post a\\nsummary (news reading time is at a premium with finals just around the\\ncorner... :( )\\n--\\nTom Willis  \\\\  twillis@ecn.purdue.edu    \\\\    Purdue Electrical Engineering\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\"Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies.\"  - F.
